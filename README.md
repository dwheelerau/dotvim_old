vundle might need to be installed?? (maybe not?)
if so just delete bundle folder and follow instructions.

youcompleteme has a python installer that is req after the vundle install:
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.py --clang-completer ##use python2, see https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe

the included .vimrc is contains the vundle install commands
